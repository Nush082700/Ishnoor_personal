Idea is to essentially create a fouth wall where when he breaks it it redirects to this github repo.

Template:https://codepen.io/ziga-miklic/pen/Fagmh [or something else that you find online]
Data: The link to the repo
How to: Have a wall and have a code which records the number of hits and after 20(cause years),
it will break the wall and redirect to the github repo. (Can make it very gamelike)
