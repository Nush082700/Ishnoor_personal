Idea is to create a wall/anything of photos
Template:https://codepen.io/AMKohn/pen/EKJHf (or any other template that you'd like)
Data: The pictures will be uploaded on google drive
How to: Essentially take pictures from google drive and display it in a dynamic motion, randomly and with constant updates.
